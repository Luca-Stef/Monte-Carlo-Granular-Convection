# Monte Carlo Granular Convection

A simulation of the Granular Convection phenomenon (also known as the Brazil Nut effect) using a monta carlo method for the movement of the particles. Only requires numpy and matplotlib.

To use, run the cells above the cell labelled ## test cell ##. Then run the test cell repeatedly to perform shake and settle operations. The power of the shake and settle operations can be varied by the position arguments, defaults are 2 and 2000 respectively.
